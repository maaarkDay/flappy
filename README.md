# TODO

1. **Create game view**: Set up a custom NSView subclass for rendering the game elements.
2. **Set up game loop**: Implement a timer to update game state at a consistent frame rate (typically 60 FPS).
3. **Add basic graphics**: Draw bird, pipes, and background. Start with simple shapes.
4. **Implement physics**: Add gravity for the bird, jumping mechanics, and collision detection.
5. **Add game mechanics**: Implement pipe spawning, scoring system, and game stat management (start screen, game over, etc).
